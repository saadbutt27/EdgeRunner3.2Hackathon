# Edge Runner 3.2 Hackathon

## Project: *X-Ray Report Generator*

### Project Description
1 - We will use Llama 3.2 (Multimodal) to develop an X-ray report generator.

2 - Normally, this report is prepared by the duty doctor, written there and then.

3 -  We automate this step by just taking a picture of the X-ray from our mobile app and then generating and sending a PDF report analyzing the X-ray.
